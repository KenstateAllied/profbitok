# My end of year German Project - Dream of Berlin

The grand finale of my Year 9 German course - a project where we choose to research and write about a German city of our choice.

I picked Berlin, simply because how it impressed me when I first stepped into this modern and yet historical city.

Now, it wasn't a coding task, but considering how I had a tiny bit of knowledge about React at that time, I decided to use my skills to represent the information in a way no one else does.

## A huge thank you to my classmate
This was a group project where I was very fortunate and glad to work with my classmate Cristina, we did a great job and the final product was *aesthetically pleasing* as my teacher said.

**Enjoy!**

Due to the poor performance, I decided to migrate to Next.js for SSG. And this improved the overall experience.
